# Drive.spk.tv

Drive.spk.tv is a web application that allows users to login using their Hive account through Hive Keychain and store files on the SPK Network. The application leverages the decentralized storage capabilities of the SPK Network, providing users with a secure and censorship-resistant way to store and manage their files.

## About the SPK Network

The SPK Network is a decentralized Web 3.0 protocol that rewards value creators and infrastructure providers by distributing tokens in a fair and autonomous manner. It offers features such as decentralized storage, token creation, NFT creation, immutable breakaway communities, and direct digital ownership of creators' accounts and digital assets.

The SPK Network aims to provide a censorship-resistant platform where creators cannot be censored by centralized gatekeepers. It encourages free speech, a marketplace of ideas, and open debate.

## Features

- User authentication using Hive Keychain
- File upload and storage on the SPK Network
- Decentralized and censorship-resistant storage
- Integration with the SPK Network's token economy
- Secure and autonomous file management

## Getting Started

To use Drive.spk.tv, follow these steps:

1. Install the Hive Keychain browser extension.

2. Visit the Drive.spk.tv web application.

3. Click on the "Login" button and authorize the application using Hive Keychain.

4. Once logged in, you can upload files by dragging and dropping them into the designated area or by using the upload button.

5. Your files will be securely stored on the SPK Network, ensuring censorship-resistance and decentralized access.

## SPK Network Elements

The SPK Network consists of various elements that work together to provide a decentralized storage and incentivization system:

- Service Infrastructure Nodes: These nodes include content storage nodes, validator nodes, content delivery network gateways, and encoding nodes. They provide the necessary infrastructure for storing, validating, and serving content on the network.

- LARYNX Miner Token: Users can lock LARYNX tokens and provide an infrastructure service to the network to mine SPK tokens. The more LARYNX locked for mining, the more profitable the mining becomes.

- BROCA Gas Token: BROCA is the network's gas token used to limit spam. It is consumed when uploading content and regenerates each day if the user powers up their liquid SPK tokens.

- SPK Token: SPK is the governance token of the network. Users can stake SPK to influence the governance of the network based on their voting weight.

For more detailed information about the SPK Network, please refer to the SPK Network Light Paper and technical documentation.
